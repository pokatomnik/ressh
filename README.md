# Ressh
The simplest way to reconnect.

Just pass the arguments you'd like to pass to the `ssh` and your ssh session will never end!

## Example
`ressh -D 1080 root@yoursever.org`

## Q/A
Q: How could I stop the ressh?

A: You have two seconds between restarts. You could press `Ctrl+C` to stop the ressh.

-----

Q: Do you have binary files?

A: [Here](/binaries/)

## Build
`build.sh` could be used to build the binaries for all platforms.

## Any Ideas?
Your PR's are welcome, any time.
